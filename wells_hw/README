This code computes drawdown due to pumping at multiple wells and a linear temporal trend. 
The code expects consistent length and time units for all the parameters.

To compile:
A makefile is provided; typing make in this folder on Linux machines should produce the executable.
Otherwise, the following commands can be entered at the prompt:

cc wells.c -lm -o wells

substituting an appropriate compiler if cc is not available.

Example:
A simple example input file is provided.
Two pumping wells and one observation well are included.
To test the example, enter:

wells ex01.wells

at the prompt. If successful, the output file 'ex01.s_point' and a debug file 'ex01.wells_debug' will be created.
More elaborate examples can be created by modifying 'ex01.wells'. Comments in 'ex01.wells' provide information about
the input parameters.
